# DayPlanner

Homework Assignment 5

Goal: to create a simple calendar application allowing the user to save events for the standard 9-5 workday.

## Description

The purpose of this application is to create a calendar for the user to save important events and manage their time better at work. This will improve the productiveness of the user and allow them to see their upcoming day's to-do list.

The user will have a text area to input what events they have for a specific hour, and click the save button within the space. Once the save button is clicked, the text will be locked into the text area so that everything will be saved once the webpage is refreshed. The user will also have colors to differentiate the hours of the day as follows:

* Previous Hours: Grey
* Current Hour: Red
* Upcoming Hours: Green

Lastly, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
